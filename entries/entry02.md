## Content: 

As I have been trying out my tool, I have been trying different functions and different tools correlated with Swift. As I was testing and trying out different functions, I kept in my mind on what this app is intended to do. 

The first thing I did was `imported UIKit`, which will help provide me with different interface elements that I will need to use to create buttons and other functions around the app. The UIKit is a collection of classes that I will be using throughout my app. One of the classes that I will need to use from the UIKit is the ViewController. It will allow me to look at the user's interface and view the code in live action. 


```java
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

}

```

I wanted to test around and see how to create a switch that users can turn on and off. You would need to use variables, methods, and functions. The way this would turn out would look like this: 

```java

import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

override func viewDidLoad() {
 super.viewDidLoad()

   let switchControl = UISwitch()
   switchControl.isOn = false
    }
    
  }

```
`During the winter break`, I want to learn and input [buttons](https://youtu.be/mWcl2aCalBQ) that lead to other pages on the app and work on the icon of the app. I will also be watching tutorials to help me play around with swift so I can improve the app. 



## Engineering Design Process: 

Currently where I am at in the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) is planning and creating a solution to my problem. Although I am testing and trying out different things, I am also planning and brainstorming on how I want things to look and function. I want my app to be simple to understand and use.  


## Skills: 

The `skills` that I have learned throughout my process of learning my tool is being observant and creative. Before I look at a specific tutorial, I keep in mind of dates of publication because videos may be outdated which may cause confusion or inaccurate information. Before I try anything, I think about the ways I can make it creative. I think about the different ways a certain thing can look or function.
