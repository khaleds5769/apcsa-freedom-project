## Content: 

The tool that I have decided on is Swift. The reason I chose Swift is that having an app that I created on the app store is truly amazing. I want to use Swift to create an app that helps students with the college process. Having an app that helps students organize their college applications would be efficient for students. 

## Engineering Design Process: 

Where I am at as of now in the [`Engineering Design Process`](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) is doing research as well as planning. I am researching my tool by watching Swift tutorials on youtube. Another source I found useful is by looking at [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) description of Swift. I have downloaded Xcode which is the "ide" that Apple created themselves. I am starting to plan how I want this app to look and do. I want my app to be as simple as possible so it is easy to understand and look at. 


## Skills: 

Skills that I have gained from the freedom project process are “Consideration” and how to google. I have chosen this issue to help solve because this year, I found it overwhelming to look at all the colleges that I want to apply to while also having a description/requirements for each college. I also learned how to google by choosing the right source/tutorial because if it is outdated or unclear, it may be harder for me to understand my tool.
