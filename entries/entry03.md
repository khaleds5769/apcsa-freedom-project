## Content

As I continue building my app on xcode using SwiftUI, I improvise on my ideas and plan. While I was thinking on my plan for my app, I realized that if I was to create a college organizer app, I would have to store users data so that they could all login to keep track of their information. I then realized that I could create a college Advisor app that will contain different types of advice on how to successfully start and finish the college application process. As I am creating my app, I am constantly thinking of how I want my app to look and function as it will be important for the precisness of the app. 

I am learning about the different types of methods and functionalities that I could use within Xcode. I found out that I can change my icon for my app and add pictures onto my app by designing my own and implementing it inside the `Assets` folder on my terminal. I also found out that `Vstack` allows to stack views vertically.  

One conflict I encountered, was that I assigned a variable to something, however, I couldn't change it later on. I later learned if you are going to change something that's assigned to a variable later on, you will need to use `@State Var` which allows the variable that is being assigned to something to be changed.

## Engineering Design Process:

Currently where I am in the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) is that I am creating my prototype but also improvising as well along the way. As I am building my app, I am changing my original ideas to new ideas that I believe will be best for me, as well as improvising my app on how things should look and function. 

## Skills:

The [`skills`](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#skills) I have gained throughout my learning process is that I am learning to have a growth mindset and become more creative. Many times as I am trying to figure things out, I feel like giving up especially when a certain code doesn't want to work or when I can't figure a certain thing out. I have learned to be patient and to learn from my process. I also learned to be more creative because as I mentioned previosly, as I am creating my app, I am changing the app througout based on what I feel like would be best which opens my creativity to a new level.
