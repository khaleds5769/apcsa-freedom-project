## Finale of the MVP: 

As I was nearing the end of the deadline for the MVP, I switched my execution method for my MVP. After making several projects and some getting erased, I came to this final project. I have used Swift Storyboard to execute my project. I finalized my MVP by adding all the necessary functions for my app. I have changed a lot during the spring break and aim to continue changing it for the final submission. Two extremely useful sources I have found in helping me learn my tool were two youtube channels. One named [Sean Allen](https://youtu.be/LbAd2FIlnos) helped me go from one ViewController to another and the other YouTuber named [Kamryn Ohly](https://youtu.be/Zvfhhud3MAc) helped me build my ScrollView. 

## Here's a look at the front page of my app!

## Here's a look at the second page of my app!

## Engineering Design Process: 

Currently where I am at in the `Engineering Design Process` is that I am testing, improving, and even starting to communicate my results. After finishing my MVP, I have already started to improve on my MVP but thinking beyond MVP. I have also started showing my peers my progress and how my app turned out like. 


## Skills:

I have gained multiple `skills` throughout learning my tool. Some skills I have learned as I wrap up the freedom project are `attention to detail` and `Consideration`. My app contains lots of sentences so making sure everything is spelled correctly and makes sense is crucial. I have doubled check my spelling by putting it on google docs and allowing Grammarly to check everything. I have also learned to be considerate when making my app. One way of doing so was by making my word choice simple and making a simple app that can be easily managed by everyone.
