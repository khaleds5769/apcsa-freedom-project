# Entry 6
##### 6/4/23

## Content:
I have had many takeaways from my presentation at the expo. Writing my elevator pitch and trying to be efficient when speaking about my project has taught me lots of things like being specific and descriptive but in a short amount of time. I have gained confidence presenting to the judges during the expo and also to the other cohorts in my school. I enjoyed talking about my project to the students that were present and not only did they learn something new, I also learned too by looking at other students' projects at the end. 


There were also lots of takeaways presented in class. When presenting in class, I feel nervous because the class is usually quiet and it's just me in front of the class speaking. Although that's how I felt at first as soon as I got in front of the class, after I started speaking, it was as if my nervousness has left the room. I have gained so much confidence presenting in class and in the expo. I was able to explain my project to my peers and show them the output of my year-long project.

## Engineering Design Process: 
Currently where I am at in the `Engineering Design Process` is that I am communicating the results. Since it's over, I presented my project during an expo using an elevator pitch and also presented it during class to my peers. Even outside of those events, I have also communicated with my peers about our projects and tried each other's projects out. 


## Skills: 

There are many `skills` I have gained throughout the end of this project. The most important skill for me as I said before was gaining confidence which is communication. I realized that presenting isn't as scary as it seems and that a person should take it as a 'show off' moment and have fun with it. Another skill I have gained is being considerate and precise with my presentation. There were lots of presentations during the expo so being considerate and having a short elevator pitch that had an overview of your project was a good way to show respect for other people's time and so that you don't bore the listener out.
