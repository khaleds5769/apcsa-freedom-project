# APCSA Freedom Project
by Khaled Saleh

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about choosing a tool to learn throughout the year and creating a project that helps solve a specific problem in the world. The purpose of this blog is to go step by step about my process in creating my project. 

## Content
For my project, I am making a college application organizer. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Swift in order to make my app for the college application organizer.
